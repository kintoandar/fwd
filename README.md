# fwd - The little forwarder that could
[![Travis](https://img.shields.io/travis/kintoandar/fwd.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/kintoandar/fwd)

## About
`fwd` is a network port forwarder written in golang.

It's cross platform, supports multiple architectures and it's dead simple to use.

Read all about it in this [article](https://blog.kintoandar.com/2016/08/fwd-the-little-forwarder-that-could.html).

## Use Cases
### fwd ‚ô•Ô∏è ngrok
I must admit `ngrok` was an huge inspiration for `fwd`. If you don't know the tool you should definitely check out [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_xNOVY96Ng) from [@inconshreveable](https://twitter.com/inconshreveable).

This tool combo (fwd + ngrok) allows some wicked mischief, like taking [firewall hole punching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hole_punching_(networking)) to another level! And the setup is trivial.

`ngrok` allows to expose a local port on a public endpoint and `fwd` allows to connect a local port to a remote endpoint. You see where I'm heading with this... With both tools you can connect a public endpoint to a remote port as long as you have access to it.

Here's how it works:

```
                              +---------+                            +---------+
                        :9000 |         |            172.28.128.3:22 |         |
Internet +------------------> |   fwd   | +------------------------> |   ssh   |
tcp.ngrok.io:1234             |         | 172.28.128.1               |         |
                              +---------+                            +---------+
```

```
# get a public endpoint, ex: tcp.ngrok.io:1234
ngrok tcp 9000

# forward connections on :9000 to 172.28.128.3:22
fwd --from :9000 --to 172.28.128.3:22

# get a shell on 172.28.128.3 via a public endpoint
ssh tcp.ngrok.io -p 1234
```

### Simple Use Case
Forwarding a local port to a remote port on a different network:

```
                             +---------+                             +---------+
           192.168.1.99:8000 |         |             172.28.128.3:80 |         |
curl +---------------------> |   fwd   | +-------------------------> |   web   |
                             |         | 172.28.128.1                |         |
                             +---------+                             +---------+
```
